# My_snake_game
PySnake is a fun and interactive snake game created in Python that brings the beloved retro arcade experience to your fingertips. Get ready for an exciting adventure as you guide your snake through a virtual maze, gobbling up tasty treats to grow longer and achieve high scores!

How to Play:

Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the movement of your snake.
Your objective is to eat as much food as possible without colliding with the walls or your snake's own tail.
Each time your snake eats food, it will grow longer, making the game progressively more challenging.
